Assessment guidance:

-Split larger string into 3 smaller strings
-Import from csv file
-Produce a function 

<>Order Matters<>

    -The compiler reads from top to bottom

    -A function needs to be defined before it is used in the program

    -'Forward declerations' = Declaring a function before it is used

    -'Function decleration' = The definition of the function without the payload i.e.

                                 int sum (int a, int b);


<>Void functions<>

    -Used to return multiple vairables

    -Used to return no variables at all



Assessment help

Create an array of struct type FITNESS_DATA (all the data in the csv file stored in this array). To determine the size of the array, we might need to find the total elements in the array first.

Write the total number of records in the file to the screen

    Number of records in file: 234

Obtain the first 3 rows of the array and write to the screen with no spaces i.e. 

    The first three rows of the array:
    2023-09-01/08:15/150
    2022-09-01/07:15/220
    2021-09-01/09:15/176
